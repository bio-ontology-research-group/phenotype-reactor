            <h5><strong>Searching Phenomebrowser</strong></h5>
            <p>Phenomebrowser has a search facility that allows querying phenotype assoications repository using 
            several databases including NCBI gene and MGI for genes, HP and MP ontology for phenotypes, diseases 
            from OMIM, DOID, MONDO, Orphanet and decipher, NCBITAXON for pathogens, PUBCHEM for drugs and CHEBI 
            for metabolites.Please follow this guide to help you querying phenomebrowser effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="home-searchbar" class="pt-4">
            <h6><strong>Search Bar</strong></h6>
            <p>Search bar is below the main menu bar. It is consists of a dropdown to select a database, user may want to search 
            concept from and an input box for searching biomedical concepts such as phenotypes, genes etc.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/help/home-srchbar.png"  alt="..." class="p-2" height="100" />
            <p>There is a button after the search input box, clicking it will display search examples in the popup window.</p>

        <div id="home-simplesearch" class="pt-4">
            <h6><strong>Simple Searching</strong></h6>
            <p>First, you can select a database from the databases dropdown such as HP for searching human phenotypes. Then, you can
            start typing the name of the phenotype in the search input box, once you start typing letter the system will provide
            suggestion based on phenotype names starting with the letters entered in the input box. Once you select one of the 
            suggested phenotypes, system will display the search results.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/help/home-simplesrch.png"  alt="..." class="p-2" height="150" />
            <p>Note that when you select one of gene databases, you can search with both gene symbol and gene name.</p>
            <p>Search results from the Phenomebrowser repository that match the query term are shown as below</p>

            <h5><strong>How do I interpret the search results?</strong></h5>
            <p>Your search results will have two parts 1) description of the term selected and 2) tabs containing associated biomedical concepts. If the term selected is
            a phenotype type, there will six tabs displayed including diease, drug, gene, metabolite and pathogen association tabs as well as similar entities tab. If the
            selected term was any other concept then phenotype, it will display 2 tabs phenotype associations and similar entities</p>
            <p>Association tabs consist of list of concepts associated it with selected term. Each tab will list specific type (such as drug, disease, gene etc) of concept associations. The content of the
            associated types is described below:</p>

            <p class="pt-4">Similar Entities tab consist of list of similar concepts to the selected term. We used the consine similarity method to compute the similarity between the biomedical concepts. The content of the
            tab is described below:</p><table class="table table-striped col-9 m-3">

                Note that if the selected term is not a phenotype, only then you will be able to the matching phenotype column. </td>

            <h6><strong>Filter Search results</strong></h6>
            <p>If your search has returned more results than you expected in association tabs, you can further filter the results by
            selecting source dataset or/and the type of evidence.</p>

            <h6><strong>Viewing Search results</strong></h6>
            <p>Search results can be viewed in a table shown below. The column names having up/down arrows after them are
            sortable. Clicking on the sortable column names will sort the column in ascending order and clicking twice will sort it in desending order.
            An up arrow means the column is sorted in ascending order and the down arrow means it is sorted in desending order.</p>

            <p>If the search results are many, you can use pagination at bottom left of the table to navigate through the results. You can also
            change the table view to show more or less results per page.</p>

            <p>There is a query editor below the results table that is shown in below figure. In the query text box, we generate the 
            equivalent SPARQL query to the results shown in the table. It allows user to access the content of the returned results
            computationally in number of formats including json, tab delimited, csv etc. You can click on run query to see the results
